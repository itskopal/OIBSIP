        <p class="sub-title">Mahendra Singh Dhoni</p>
        <p class="info-title">Cricketer</p>
        <p class="info">He is the first cricketer to be a winning captain of all 
            three major ICC trophies, as under his captaincy, India won the 2007 
            ICC World Twenty20, the 2011 Cricket World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions 
            Trophy, the most by any captain. He also led India to victory in the 2010 
            and 2016 Asia Cup. Additionally, under his leadership, India won the 2010 
            and 2011 ICC Test Mace and 2013 ICC ODI Championship. He has scored 17,266 
            runs in International Cricket (including 10,000 plus runs in ODI Internationals). 
            Dhoni is a right-handed wicket-keeper batsman known for his calm captaincy 
            and his ability to finish matches in tight situations for these reasons he 
            is considered one of the best finishers in the game ever, as well as one of 
            the greatest wicket-keepers and captains in the history of cricket.

                <p>In January of 2017, he stepped down as captain of both ODIs and T20Is. 
                    As India’s top wicket-keeper in limited overs cricket, he served until 
                    the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2019, which marked his 4th and last 
                    edition as captain.
                    Dhoni was an integral part of India’s game for nearly 10 years, 
                    scoring 4876 runs at 38.09 over 90 tests. <br>
                    Dhoni, born in Ranchi, made his international debut for India during their 
                    Bangladesh tour as the wicket-keeper batsman. In only his fifth ODI against 
                    Pakistan at No.3, he scored his first ton with an incredible 148 that set 
                    the standard for his relaxed fast batting style which would remain with him 
                    for the next decade. <br>
                    Dhoni’s record-setting unbeaten 183 against Sri Lanka last year further cemented 
                    his reputation as a big-hitting wicket-keeper and remains the highest score 
                    for an Indian wicket keeper in ODIs. As Dhoni continued to develop his game, 
                    becoming an orchestrator in the middle of the order and also leading chases 
                    to boost his ODI profile. Last 3rd year he joined just five Indians in 
                    reaching 10,000 runs in ODIs <br>
                    Unfortunately, the last ODI he played ended up being an 18-run World 
                    Cup semi-final loss to New Zealand on 10 July 2019. <br>
                    Dhoni quickly made himself known as one of cricket’s quickest stumpers, 
                    boasting his safe method of catching and lightning-fast reaction times. As 
                    the third most successful international wicket-keeper (829 dismissals) and 
                    only player to record over 100 stumpings in an ODI match, his performance 
                    was truly remarkable. <br>
                    Captaining India, Dhoni enjoyed international success, particularly in 
                    limited-overs games. Under his leadership, India reached No.1 on Tests in 
                    2009 – which coincided with his own rise to an enviable position on ODI 
                    batting charts. Furthermore, India boasted a remarkable home record; losing 
                    only one game since 2006. One of Dhoni’s greatest moments was whitewashing 
                    Australia 4-0 in their home opener of 2013 which marked one of his greatest 
                    triumphs as captain; that series saw one of his highest scores ever (224). <br>
                    Dhoni’s innovative captaincy style in T20Is and ODIs was the cornerstone of India’s 
                    development into a formidable white-ball powerhouse. Perhaps his most 
                    memorable ODI performance came during 2011, in the World Cup final against 
                    Sri Lanka where he edged out Yuvraj Singh for an unbeaten 91 and finished 
                    the game with an unforgettable six. <br>
                    Dhoni captained India during 200ODIs and maintained an average win-per-inning 
                    of 59.52 while earning his three ICC titles. Other noteworthy victories for
                    him included an historic ODI triseries victory on Australian soil in 2008 
                    as well as Asia Cup victories in 2010 and 2016.
